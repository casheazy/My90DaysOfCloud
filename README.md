# My90DaysOfCloud
This repository will document my 90 days of learning DevOps and I will be dedicating an hour each day to complete this journey.I will be starting this journey on the 20th September 2023 but the idea is that I will take 90 days to complete this journey

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

The goal is to take 90 days, 1 hour each a day, to tackle over 13 areas of "DevOps" to a foundational knowledge.

This will not cover all things "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.
